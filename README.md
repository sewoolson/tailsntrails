# Tails&Trails

## Project overview
Tails&Trails is a landing page designed for pet owners who need reliable, local pet walkers on specific dates. It’s aimed at owners who are busy, traveling, or otherwise unavailable for short or extended periods of time.

The platform is community-based, featuring background-checked pet walkers vetted by local members. Transparent pricing and community recommendations help build trust and reduce friction when signing up for services.


## Design Process (Figma)
The layout was informed by competitor analysis of Rover, Wag, and Care.com, identifying common patterns and trends across established pet-care platforms. The final structure follows familiar content hierarchies and F-pattern scanning behavior to support quick decision-making.

Typography choices include Roboto for body text and Sansita for the logo and headers to create a friendly yet professional tone. Line height was set to 1.5rem, with interactive elements meeting the 44px minimum height to support accessibility best practices.

The primary constraint was designing only the landing page while still considering reusable components for future global use. During iteration, color choices were adjusted to ensure WCAG-compliant contrast ratios after initial combinations did not meet accessibility standards.


## Development process (VS Code)
Tech stack:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

During development, I encountered an unexpected GitHub push error that blocked updates from appearing in the repository. The error indicated that GitHub accepted the connection, began receiving data, and then terminated the connection mid-push.

After troubleshooting, I identified the issue as Git’s default http.postBuffer size being too small for the compressed payload. Increasing the buffer size resolved the problem and allowed the push to complete successfully.

This experience reinforced the importance of debugging beyond surface-level error messages and gaining a deeper understanding of how development tools behave under the hood.


## Future Improvements.
Future iterations could include subtle animations while maintaining performance, additional accessibility enhancements, and further refinement of responsive behavior.

The scope of this project was intentionally limited to a landing page intended as a reusable template, so any future work would focus on incremental improvements rather than expanded features.
